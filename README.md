Three parts in the analysis are described here.

## Model of track survival

The monitoring of the detection of body pits allow to estimate the duration of detection of a body pit.

## Phenology estimation based on body pit counts and Global estimation

This is the intra-seasonal and inter-seasonal estimation of missing information.
